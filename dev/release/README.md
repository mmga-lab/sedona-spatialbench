# Releasing SpatialBench

## Verifying a release candidate

### Testing locally (before creating a release candidate)

Before creating a release candidate, you should test your local checkout:

```shell
# git clone https://github.com/apache/sedona-spatialbench.git && cd sedona-spatialbench
# or
# cd existing/sedona-spatialbench && git fetch upstream && git switch main && git pull upstream main
dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh
```

This will run all verification tests on your local checkout without requiring any release artifacts.

### Testing a local tarball

To create a local tarball for testing:

```shell
VERSION="0.1.0" && git archive HEAD --prefix=apache-sedona-spatialbench-${VERSION}/ | gzip > apache-sedona-spatialbench-${VERSION}-src.tar.gz
dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh apache-sedona-spatialbench-${VERSION}-src.tar.gz
```

### Verifying an official release candidate

Once a release candidate has been uploaded to Apache dist, verify it using:

```shell
dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh 0.1.0 1
```

This will download the release candidate from `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/sedona/` and verify it.

Release verification requires:
- A recent Rust toolchain (can be installed from <https://rustup.rs/>)
- Java (for Apache RAT license checking)
- Python (for RAT report filtering)

The verification script will:
1. Run Apache RAT to check all files have proper license headers
2. Build and test all Rust crates in the workspace

When verifying via Docker or on a smaller machine it may be necessary to limit the
number of parallel jobs to avoid running out of memory:

```shell
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
```

## Creating a release

Create a release branch on the corresponding remote pointing to the official Apache
repository (i.e., <https://github.com/apache/sedona-spatialbench>). This step must be done by
a committer.

```shell
git pull upstream main
git branch -b branch-0.1.0
git push upstream -u branch-0.1.0:branch-0.1.0
```

When the state of the `branch-x.x.x` branch is clean and checks are complete,
the release candidate tag can be created:

```shell
git tag -a sedona-spatialbench-0.1.0-rc1 -m "Tag Apache Sedona SpatialBench 0.1.0-rc1"
git push upstream sedona-spatialbench-0.1.0-rc1
```

### Signing Commands

Now the assets need to be signed with signatures. 

**GPG Signing:**

```shell
# Sign a file (creates .asc file automatically)
gpg -ab apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz

# Verify a signature
gpg --verify apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz.asc apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz
```

**SHA512 Checksum:**

```shell
# Generate SHA512 checksum
shasum -a 512 apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz > apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz.sha512

# Verify a checksum
shasum -a 512 --check apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz.sha512
```

**Upload to Apache SVN:**

After the assets are signed, they can be committed and uploaded to the
dev/sedona directory of the Apache distribution SVN:

```shell
# Set version and RC number variables
SEDONA_VERSION="0.1.0"
RC_NUMBER="1"

# Create the directory in SVN
svn mkdir -m "Adding folder" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/sedona/sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-rc${RC_NUMBER}

# Checkout the directory
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/sedona/sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-rc${RC_NUMBER} tmp

# Copy files to the checked out directory
cp apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz tmp/
cp apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz.asc tmp/
cp apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz.sha512 tmp/

# Add and commit the files
cd tmp
svn add apache-sedona-spatialbench-${SEDONA_VERSION}-src.tar.gz*
svn ci -m "Apache SpatialBench ${SEDONA_VERSION} RC${RC_NUMBER}"
cd ..
rm -rf tmp
```

## Vote

An email must now be sent to `dev@sedona.apache.org` calling on developers to follow
the release verification instructions and vote appropriately on the source release.

## Bump versions

After a successful release, versions on the `main` branch need to be updated. These
are currently all derived from `Cargo.toml`, which can be updated to:

```
[workspace.package]
version = "0.2.0"
```

## Publishing to crates.io

After a successful Apache release, the Rust crates can be published to [crates.io](https://crates.io).

### Prerequisites

1. **crates.io account**: Create an account at <https://crates.io> if you don't have one
2. **API token**: Generate an API token from <https://crates.io/me>
3. **Login to cargo**: Authenticate cargo with your API token:
   ```shell
   cargo login <your-api-token>
   ```
4. **Verify ownership**: Ensure you have owner permissions for the crates on crates.io. If this is the first publish, you'll automatically become an owner.

### Pre-publish checks

Before publishing, verify that:

1. All tests pass:
   ```shell
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

2. The workspace builds successfully:
   ```shell
   cargo build --workspace --release
   ```

3. Check for any issues with `dry run`:
   ```shell
   cargo publish --dry-run
   ```

### Publishing order

The crates will be published in dependency order. The correct order is:

1. `spatialbench` (no workspace dependencies)
2. `spatialbench-arrow` (depends on `spatialbench`)
3. `spatialbench-cli` (depends on both `spatialbench` and `spatialbench-arrow`)

To publish, run this command:

```shell
cargo publish
```
